### Please Note ###
There are really only 3 files needed to run entire site. These files can be located in the following below.

- index.php 
- Repository/ProductRepository.class.php
- Models/ProductModel.class.php (Supplied Code by ezyVet)

The rest of the files located in **Controllers** and **Interface** are just a pattern that I wanted to use but is not required. To remove this pattern, simply uncomment a single line and comment out 2 lines located in the **index.php** file. The instructions can be found in the **index.php** file of which lines to comment and uncomment.
